- Then right-click on the ArcToolbox window and select “Add Toolbox”. Navigate to the location of the SSOS tool and click “Open”. 
- Next, import the script “ssos.py” into the toolbox. To do this, right-click on “Seafloor Score to Oil Sensitivity – SSOS” and go to “Properties”, then on the “Source” tab click on the “Script File” option and click on the “OK” button.
